## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Analyzed **coffee sales data** (Kaggle) in **Google Colab** to uncover customer behavior, purchase trends, and spending patterns. The goal is to support **data-driven decisions** in marketing, inventory, and sales optimization.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels  
- **Platform**: Google Colab  
- **Techniques**: Descriptive Stats, Chi-Square, ANOVA, Correlation, Visualizations  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights
- **Peak Hours**: 10 AM â€“ 6 PM (max at 2 PM).  
- **Spending**: Avg. â‚¹28â€“â‚¹36, max â‚¹38.7.  
- **Trends**: Peaks in Mayâ€“Jun & Octâ€“Nov; stable across 2024â€“25.

## ðŸ’¡ Applications
- Targeted promotions at peak hours  
- Inventory planning by season  
- Data-driven pricing by coffee type

## âœ… Conclusion
Coffee sales are **time-dependent, stable year-to-year, and product-sensitive**.  
This project improved my **EDA, visualization, and statistical reasoning** skills while showing how **AI tools support analysis & reporting**.
